# Squaring an Argument

# Using the multiply method from the "Multiplying Two Numbers" problem, write a method 
# that computes the square of its argument (the square is the result of multiplying a number by itself).


def multiply(num1, num2)
  num1 * num2
end

def square(num)
  multiply(num, num)
end

# Test:
p square(5) == 25
p square(-8) == 64
